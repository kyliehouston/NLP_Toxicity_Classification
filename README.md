## Overview

This file provides instructions to run each of our 4 models individually

## Models

| Script | Model | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `nbc.py` | Naive Bayes | TF-IDF + Multinomial Naive Bayes baseline |
| `bert_baseline.py` | BERT-base | Full fine-tuning with a classification head |
| `bert_lora.py` | BERT-base + LoRA | Parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA |
| `bert_large.py` | BERT-large + LoRA | Larger backbone with LoRA fine-tuning |

```

## Setup

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Models

Each script loads data from the `data/` directory, trains the model, and prints the classification report and confusion matrix to the console.

```bash
python nbc.py
python bert_baseline.py
python bert_lora.py
python bert_large.py
```

**Note:** The BERT models require a CUDA-capable GPU for reasonable training times. They were developed and tested on Google Colab T4 GPU with converging times aroudn 8 minutes for each model.

## Dataset

The dataset is derived from the [DOTA 2 Toxic Chat Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OxAISH-AL-LLM/wiki_toxic) on Hugging Face. Messages were re-annotated into three classes (Neutral, Banter, Toxic) manually.
